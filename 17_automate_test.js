// Why do we need tests in JavaScript?
// 1. To ensure code correctness and reliability by catching bugs early in the development process.

// 2. To facilitate code maintenance and refactoring by providing a safety net against regressions.

// 3. To improve code quality and design by encouraging modular and testable code structures.

// 4. To enhance collaboration among developers by providing clear expectations of code behavior through tests.

// 5. To support continuous integration and deployment processes by automating testing and ensuring code stability.

// ⚠️ Tests are not a substitute for good code quality, but they are an essential part of the development process 
// that helps ensure the code behaves as expected and meets requirements.

// ⚠️ When we develop something, we keep a lot of possible use cases in mind. 
// But it’s hard to expect a programmer to check all of them manually after every change. 
// So it becomes easy to fix one thing and break another one.

// Automated testing means that tests are written separately, in addition to the code. 
// They run our functions in various ways and compare results with the expected.

// This way, we can be sure that the code works as expected and that it will continue to work
// correctly after changes.
// Automated tests are scripts that run automatically to check if the code behaves as expected.

// Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration between developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders to define the behavior of the application in a way that is understandable to all parties. BDD focuses on the expected behavior of the application rather than its implementation details, allowing for clearer communication and better alignment with business requirements.
