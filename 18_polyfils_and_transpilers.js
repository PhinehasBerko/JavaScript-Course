// How to make our modern code work on older engines that don’t understand recent features yet?

// There are two tools for that:

// 1. Transpilers.
// 2. Polyfills.

// Transpilers
// A transpiler is a special piece of software that translates source code to another 
// source code. It can parse (“read and understand”) modern code and rewrite 
// it using older syntax constructs, so that it’ll also work in outdated engines.
